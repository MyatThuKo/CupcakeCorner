<h1> Day 49, 50, 51 of 100 Days of SwiftUI </h1>
<p> Creating a Cupcake Order App that allows 
<ol> 
<li> Adding Codable conformance for @Published properties </li>
<li> Sending and receiving Codable data with URLSession and SwiftUI </li>
<li> Validating and disabling forms </li>
<li> Encoding an ObservableObject class </li>
<li> Sending and receiving orders over the internet </li>
</ol> 
</p> 

<h1> Day 52, Challenge Day </h1> 
<p> The challenges to complete are 
<ol> 
<li> Improving the validation on Address TextField i.e. removing white spaces </li> 
<li> Alertiing the user about the connection to the internet, if there is no, it will fail to place an order </li> 
<li><b> For a more challenging task, see if you can convert our data model from a class to a struct, then create an ObservableObject class wrapper around it that gets passed around. This will result in your class having one @Published property, which is the data struct inside it, and should make supporting Codable on the struct much easier
</b></li>
</ol>
Still finding a way to complete challenge 3.
